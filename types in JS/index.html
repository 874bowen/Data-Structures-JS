     <h1>UNDEFINED </h1> <p>is the value assigned to things that don't yet have a value
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var x; //undefined<br>
property that doesn't exist/ deleted - undefined
dog.name -> does not exist then it is UNDEFINED
UNDEFINED is when you have a variable that hasn't been initialized, or 
an object with a missing property, or an array with a missing value
<h1>NULL</h1> 
<p>in places where an object should be 
but one can't be created or found, and it is most common to find <br>
Used when we intend to assign an object to this variable at some point, but we haven't yet.
<br> &nbsp; var to_be_assigned_later = null;
</p>
<h1>NaN</h1>
<p>
NaN MAY BE THE WEIRDEST VALUE IN THE WORLD. Not only does it represent all the numeric values that can't be represented, it is the only value in JavaScript that isn't equal to itself!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NaN != NaN<br>
You heard that right. If you compare 
NaN to NaN, they aren't equal!<br>
<strong>NaN is simply a <i>Number that cannot be represented</i>(at least by a computer)</strong>
